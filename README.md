# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:
- Train and evaluate 6 different models to predict credit risk and try evaluate the results of good loans to risky loans

## Results:

- The Oversampling algorithm predicted credit risk with an 63.47% accuracy score.

- The Random Forest classifier algorithm predicted credit risk with an 90.63% accuracy score.

- The Easy Ensemble Classifier algorithm predicted credit risk with an 78.71% accuracy score. 



## Summary:

- While most models were within 60%-70% accurate, the random forest classifier model predicted just over 90% accuracy. 

- Moving forward, I would recommend random forest classifier model as it was over 90% accuracy score.
