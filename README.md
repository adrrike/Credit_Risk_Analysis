# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:
- Train and evaluate 6 different models to predict credit risk and try evaluate the results of good loans to risky loans

## Results:
There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score (15 pt)

- Oversampling

- SMOTE Oversampling 

- Undersampling 

- Combination sampling

- Random Forest classifier

- Easy Ensemble Classifier

## Summary:

There is a summary of the results (2 pt)
- While most models were within 60%-70% accurate, the random forest classifier model predicted just over 90% accuracy. 

There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification (3 pt)
- I would recommend random forest classifier model as it was over 90% accuracy score.
